Automation frameworks provide a structured and standardized way to create, maintain, and execute automated test scripts. Instead of writing raw, repetitive test code, a framework establishes reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

Key Reasons

Maintainability:
Code changes in mobile apps are frequent. Using a Page Object Model (POM) keeps UI locators and business logic separated, so updates are easier.

Reusability:
Common actions (login, navigation, waits) can be reused across multiple tests — reducing redundancy.

Scalability:
New test cases or new app modules can be added without rewriting existing code.

Consistency & Reporting:
Frameworks ensure all tests follow a common pattern and generate consistent, detailed reports (via Allure).

CI/CD Integration:
Structured frameworks can easily integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Bitrise for continuous testing.

Cross-Platform Testing:
With Appium, the same framework can automate both Android and iOS using a single codebase.
